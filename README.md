### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm student of Sevastopol State University

I want to make own wold better and I can use information technologies to do it!

Now I work for my university but in future I will make some pet-projects to make own (or only my) wold better.

My team is CatFellowship -- it is the best team what I know among my coursemates.
